// HERE IS HOW TO DEPLOY A VERSION OF ADVERTISING MANAGER

TRANSLATIONS
    1.  Generate a translation pot template here:
    http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advertising-manager/admin/

    2. Sign into Transifex and add the pot file by going to:
    https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/advertising-manager-1/resources/
    and clicking on ‘add new resource.’

    3. Click the translation template and select the translation language

    4. If an mo file exists for that language, convert to po file, then upload po file:
    msgunfmt advman-lang.mo > advman-lang.po

    5. Click ‘Translate Now’ to translate
    
    6. After translating and reviewing, go to Advertising Manager Overview page by clicking
    ‘Advertising Manager’ on the top left-hand corner. 

    7. Click on the translation language, then on the pot template
    
    8. Download for translation
    NOTE: ‘Download for translation’ generates a po file consisting of everything in the pot file.
    ‘Download only reviewed translations’ generates a po file consisting of only the translations that were
    saved and reviewed.

    9. Copy po file to /languages, then add and commit file:
    svn add advman-lang.po
    svn commit -m “adding new translation files”

    10. Convert po file to mo file:
    msgfmt -o advman-lang.po advman-lang.mo
