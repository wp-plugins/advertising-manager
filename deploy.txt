// HERE IS HOW TO DEPLOY A VERSION OF ADVERTISING MANAGER

TRANSLATIONS

  NEW:
    1.  Generate a translation pot template here:
    http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advertising-manager/admin/

    2. Sign into Transifex and add the pot file by going to:
    https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/advertising-manager-1/resources/
    and clicking on ‘add new resource.’

  COMPLETED:
    1. On Advertising Manager Overview page, click on the translation language, then on
    the pot template
    
    2. Download for translation
    NOTE: ‘Download for translation’ generates a po file consisting of everything in the
    pot file. 
    ‘Download only reviewed translations’ generates a po file consisting of only the
    translations that were saved and reviewed.

    3. Copy po file to /languages, then add and commit file:
    svn add advman-lang.po
    svn commit -m “adding new translation files”

    4. Convert po file to mo file:
    msgfmt -o advman-lang.po advman-lang.mo

    5. Commit mo files:
    svn commit -m “adding new mo files”
